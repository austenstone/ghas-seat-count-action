# GHAS Seat Count Action

An [Action](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) to get the number of GHAS seats and optionally calculate the percentage used as well as the number of seats remaining.

> **Warning**
> Because the GitHub API does not return the maximum number of seats in your current plan you will need to specify this as an input to the action via the `max_advanced_security_committers` variable. If left unset the action will only return the total number of seats currently used.

## Usage
Create a workflow (eg: `.github/workflows/seat-count.yml`). See [Creating a Workflow file](https://help.github.com/en/articles/configuring-a-workflow#creating-a-workflow-file).

### PAT(Personal Access Token)

You will need to [create a PAT(Personal Access Token)](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new?scopes=admin:org) that has `admin:org` access.

Add this PAT as a secret so we can use it as input `github-token`, see [Creating encrypted secrets for a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository). 
### Organizations

If your organization has SAML enabled you must authorize the PAT, see [Authorizing a personal access token for use with SAML single sign-on](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/authentication/authenticating-with-saml-single-sign-on/authorizing-a-personal-access-token-for-use-with-saml-single-sign-on).


#### Example
```yml
name: Check GHAS Seats
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: 0 0 * * *

jobs:
  seats:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: austenstone/ghas-seat-count-action@main
        id: seats
        with:
          org: octodemo
          github-token: ${{secrets.TOKEN}}
          max_advanced_security_committers: 200
    outputs:
      percentage: ${{steps.seats.outputs.percentage}}
      remaining: ${{steps.seats.outputs.remaining}}
  more-than-90-percent:
    needs: [seats]
    if: needs.seats.outputs.percentage > 90
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: echo More than 90% of seats used!
```

To count the total seats in the enterprise instead of an org specify the enterprise input variable instead.
```yml
        with:
          enterprise: github
```
